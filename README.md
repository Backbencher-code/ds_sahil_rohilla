# Bitcoin Market Sentiment vs Trader Behavior Analysis

## Overview
This repository presents an analysis of how Bitcoin market sentiment influences trader behavior
and performance on the Hyperliquid trading platform. The study combines the Bitcoin Fear & Greed
Index with historical trade-level data to examine changes in profitability, risk exposure, and
trading activity across different market sentiment regimes.

The analysis period spans **December 2024 to April 2025** and focuses primarily on Bitcoin (BTC)
trades to ensure direct alignment with the sentiment indicator.

## Google Colab Notebook

All analysis was developed and executed using **Google Colab**.

- **Main notebook:** `notebook_1.ipynb`  
- **Colab link (view-only):**  
  👉 https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1jWOu1hMD-Ei1zuXc1yG4SBPUOTKUkqfZ?usp=sharing 

The same notebook file has been downloaded from Colab and included in this repository to
maintain structural consistency.

## Data Notes

- The original Hyperliquid trader dataset (~45 MB) exceeds GitHub’s file size limit.
- A **representative sampled version** of the trader dataset has been uploaded to this repository
  for reference.
- **All analysis and results were generated using the complete dataset in Google Colab.**

This approach ensures transparency while complying with GitHub size constraints.

## Outputs

All visualizations generated during exploratory analysis and validation are saved as image files
in the `outputs/` directory. These figures support the numerical findings presented in the final
report.

## Final Report

- **File:** `ds_report.pdf`
- Contains the final summarized insights, interpretations, and strategic implications derived
  from the analysis.
- The report is intentionally separated from the notebook to maintain a clear distinction
  between technical analysis and business-level conclusions.

---

## Notes

- Bitcoin market sentiment is treated as a macro-level risk indicator rather than a directional
  trading signal.
- Leverage effects are inferred indirectly through position sizing due to the absence of explicit
  leverage data.
- Findings are observational and do not imply causality.
